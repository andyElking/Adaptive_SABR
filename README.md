for adaptive and high order SDE solvers"</h1>
<h2 align='center'>by Andraž Jelinčič, James Foster and Patrick Kidger</h2>

The paper is available at TBA.

This repository is based on the Diffrax package by Patrick Kidger, which is available at [github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
The documentation for Diffrax can be found at [docs.kidger.site/diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax).

The code for the SABR model example is in `notebooks/SABR.ipynb`.

To use the code, clone this repository and install the requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username-here/Single-seed_BrownianMotion.git
cd Single-seed_BrownianMotion/
pip install -e .
