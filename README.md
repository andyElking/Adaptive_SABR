<h1 align='center'>Adaptive SDE solvers for the SABR model</h1>
<h2 align='center'>by Andraž Jelinčič and James Foster</h2>

This repository contains numerical examples for the paper "On the Convergence of Adaptive Approximations for Stochastic Differential Equations" which can be found at TBA.

This code is based on the Diffrax package by Patrick Kidger, which is available at [github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
The documentation for Diffrax can be found at [docs.kidger.site/diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax).

The code for the SABR model example is in `notebooks/SABR.ipynb`.

To use this code, clone the repository and install the requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username-here/Single-seed_BrownianMotion.git
cd Single-seed_BrownianMotion/
pip install -e .
```
